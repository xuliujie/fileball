                <h1>Get Started:</h1>

                <h2>Principle of operation:</h2>
                <p>
                    Players deposit skins in a round.<br>
                    When the number of required deposited skins is reached, a winner will be picked based on the number
                    of tickets his deposit worth and will be awarded all the skins in the pot!<br>
                    For every $0.01 a player will get 1 ticket, so a higher number of tickets means a better chance of
                    winning! You can see the details under the <a href="/provably-fair/">Provably Fair section</a>.</p>

                <h2>How to play?</h2>
                <ol style="margin-bottom:30px;">
                    <li>You should login with your Steam account.</li>
                    <li>
                        Set your trade link by editing your Steam Profile URL.
                        <p>This is a necessary step to receive the items you win and also to deposit skins.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After it you can start to deposit. Verify the total value of your bet and confirm to enter the
                        current round.
                        <p>(So you can not accidentally deposit your skins, you have to confirm it on this page!)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the item threshold of 50 items is reached, the winner will be announced.<br>
                        If you won, you will receive all the items in the pot and you will receive a tradeoffer very
                        soon.
                    </li>
                </ol>
